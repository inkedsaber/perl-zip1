# perl zip1
Script that makes my life a little bit easier.
Probably useless for most people, created mostly for fun.


# Overview:

Script (for now) that simply renames all your files in one directory of your
choice with '.zip1' extension to '.zip'.


*TODO: Prerequisites.*


# Usage:

```
Usage:  /path/to/zip1 [options] [path]
        -h, --help
        -e, --extract
```

# Script that makes my life a little bit easier.
Probably useless for most people, created mostly for fun.

**Overview:**

Script (for now) that simply renames all your files in one directory of your
choice with '.zip1' extension to '.zip'.

*TODO: Prerequisites.*

**Usage:**

For now, you to be in the directory with 'zip1.pl' script in order to run it.

```perl /path/to/perl-zip1/zip1.pl [path to folder where 'zip1' files located]```

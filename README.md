# perl zip1
Script that makes my life a little bit easier.
Probably useless for most people, created mostly for fun.


# Overview:

Script (for now) that simply renames all your files in one directory of your
choice with '.zip1' extension to '.zip'.


*TODO: Prerequisites.*


# Usage:

```
Usage:
  --dir,-d        Directory where '.zip1' files located (required)
  --extract,-e    Extract content from renamed files
  --verbose,-v    Display additional info
  --help,-h       Print this help
```
